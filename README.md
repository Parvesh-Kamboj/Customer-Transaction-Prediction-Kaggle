# Customer-Transaction-Prediction-Kaggle
This project is to predict whether a customer will complete a transaction or not.
1. The training and test datasets can be downloaded from kaggle using the link:
   https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data
2. The ipynb notebook also contains exploratory data analysis of training as well as test datasets.
3. We have also generated some of new statistical features and added them to make better predictions.
4. We are able to achieve ROC AUC score of 0.89952 using the trained LightGBM model. There is furher scope to improve the model.   
5. Note: you may require LightGBM to be installed on your machine to run the above code. You can follow the below link for installation of LightGBM on Mac    OS  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-xgboost-and-lightgbm-on-macos/
6. Note: This code as been completed after taking help from many online resources like https://programmerclick.com/article/2494745282/
